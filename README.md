## General Info
This tool will download all episodes of a given podcast from podtail.com,
assuming an mp3 or any other file type is freely available to download.

No more manually clicking every single episode; just catch'em <span style="font-weight:bold;">all</span>!

## Setup and Usage
Download and install DMD from https://dlang.org/download.html to compile ptdownloader.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/horstine1337/ptdownloader.git
$ cd ./podtail_downloader
$ dmd ptdownloader.d dom.d
$ ./ptdownloader https://podtail.com/podcast/NAME/

$ Alternatively, to set a custom download directory
$ ./ptdownloader https://podtail.com/podcast/NAME/ ./download/directory/

$ Alternatively, set the lookup for download URLs to document element, instead of regex
$ ./ptdownloader dom https://podtail.com/podcast/NAME/ [./download/directory/]
```

Don't forget to put the "/" at the end of your download directory path. Or "\\" on Windows (not tested).

The optional `dom` option will switch between the look up methods for the download URLs.
The default way to look up podcast episodes is by utilizing regex and finding URLs ending with ".mp3".

The dom option will instead try to download anything in the "href" of any html element with `title="Download"`,
using CSS selector `a[title*=\"Download\"]`

## Precompiled Binaries
Crosscompiling to another OS didn't work for me, so the provided binary `ptdownloader` is for Linux x64.
